### 1. Fruit Ripeness Identification Using YOLOv8 Model

- **Summary:** This paper presents a study on the application of deep learning models, particularly YOLOv8 and CenterNet, for the classification of fruits as ripe or overripe based on digital images. It delves into the extraction of visual features and analysis of fruit peel characteristics to accurately predict fruit ripeness. Utilizing custom datasets for training, YOLOv8 demonstrated a remarkable classification accuracy of 99.5%, attributed to its CSP and C2f modules. This underscores YOLOv8's superior performance in identifying fruit ripeness compared to CenterNet.

### 2. Advancing Plastic Waste Classification and Recycling Efficiency: Integrating Image Sensors and Deep Learning Algorithms

- **Summary:** This article explores an innovative method to enhance plastic waste classification and recycling efficiency by integrating image sensors with the YOLO deep learning model. Focusing on the physical shape of waste, this approach addresses the challenge of distinguishing chemically similar plastics like PET and PET-G. With an accuracy exceeding 91.7%, this method outperforms traditional sorting techniques, promising a more effective, scalable, and adaptable system for various applications. This significantly advances recycling processes and contributes to environmental sustainability.
