# Spare-it: Contamination Identification

## Project Description

[Spare-it](https://www.spare-it.com/) is dedicated to assisting businesses, office owners, and universities in obtaining real-time data on various types of workspace waste, including general waste, recycling, electronics, energy, water, and travel. The organization motivates employees and students to minimize waste through awareness and actionable intelligence.
